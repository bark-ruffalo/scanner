# Virtuals Protocol Launchpad

## Overview
Virtuals Protocol is a decentralized platform for the creation, ownership, and utilization of AI agents. The protocol enables the launch of two types of agents: IP Agents (character-based) and Functional Agents (utility-based), through an innovative launchpad mechanism called Initial Agent Offering (IAO).

## Launchpad Mechanism

### Initial Agent Offering (IAO)
The IAO is Virtuals Protocol's mechanism for launching new AI agents, similar to how traditional launchpads bring new tokens to market. The process involves:

1. **Agent Creation**: Initial creation requires 100 $VIRTUAL tokens
2. **Bonding Curve Phase**: The agent is deployed on a bonding curve where users can buy and sell agent tokens
3. **Graduation**: Once 42,000 $VIRTUAL has accumulated in the bonding curve, the agent "graduates"
4. **DEX Listing**: Liquidity pool is deployed on Uniswap with the agent token paired against $VIRTUAL

### On-Chain Creation Process
When an agent graduates from the bonding curve phase, the following on-chain processes occur:

1. **NFT Minting**: The agent is minted as an NFT (stored in the Agent Creation Factory)
2. **Contribution Vault**: An Immutable Contribution Vault (ICV) is created to store all contributions
3. **Token Creation**: An ERC-20 token is created for the agent with a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens
4. **Liquidity Pool**: Liquidity is added to Uniswap with the accumulated $VIRTUAL tokens
5. **Staking**: Liquidity tokens are staked with a 10-year lock period

## Ownership Model

### Co-ownership Structure
Virtuals Protocol implements a co-ownership model for AI agents through:

- **Token-based Ownership**: Holders of agent tokens have fractional ownership
- **Revenue Distribution**: Revenue from agent utilization is used for token buyback and burn
- **Agent SubDAO Governance**: Token holders can participate in governance decisions

### Contribution Framework
The protocol encourages various types of contributions:

- **Model Contributors**: Technical contributions to the agent's capabilities
- **Data Contributors**: Providing training data and feedback
- **IP Contributors**: Supplying intellectual property for agents

## Technical Infrastructure

### Modular Consensus Framework
A framework that enables:
- Transparent and composable agent development
- Decentralized contribution validation
- Core components including Cognitive, Voice, and Visual cores

### Immutable Contribution Vault
An on-chain repository that:
- Maintains transparency of all contributions
- Ensures proper attribution through NFTs
- Creates a multilayered structure for agent components

## Practical Example

When an agent like "Luna" is created, it starts on a bonding curve. As investors purchase tokens, the price increases. Upon reaching the 42,000 $VIRTUAL threshold, the agent graduates to become a fully tradable asset with:

1. Its own $LUNA token on Uniswap
2. Formalized on-chain representation
3. Revenue-generating capabilities through the protocol's ecosystem

*Note: Agent graduation typically results in the original bonding curve tokens being burned, which is not a red flag but rather indicates successful progression to DEX trading.*
